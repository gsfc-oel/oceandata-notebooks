    "\n",
    "In this example we will use the `earthaccess` package to search for\n",
    "OCI products on NASA Earthdata. The `earthaccess` package, published\n",
    "on the [Python Package Index][pypi] and [conda-forge][conda],\n",
    "facilitates discovery and use of all NASA Earth Science data\n",
    "products by providing an abstraction layer for NASAâ€™s [Common\n",
    "Metadata Repository (CMR) API][cmr] and by simplifying requests to\n",
    "NASA's [Earthdata Cloud][edcloud]. Searching for data is more\n",
    "approachable using `earthaccess` when compared to using low-level\n",
    "HTTP requests or working diectly with S3 object stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, `earthaccess` helps **authenticate** with Earthdata Login,\n",
    "makes **search** easier, and provides a stream-lined way to **load\n",
    "data** into `xarray` containers. For more on `earthaccess`, visit\n",
    "the [documentation][earthaccess-docs] site. Be aware that\n",
    "`earthaccess` is under active development.\n",

    "1. The notebook is running on the local host. A Jupyter server on your laptop is a local host.\n",
    "1. The notebook is running on a remote host, but it does not have direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud. For instance, [GitHub Codespaces][codespaces] is a remote host that runs on a different cloud platform than the NASA Earthdata Cloud.\n",
