# # Matchups of in situ data with satellite data using the ThoMaS match-up toolkit
# **Authors:** Anna Windle (NASA, SSAI), James Allen (NASA, Morgan State University), Juan Ignacio Gossn (EUMETSAT), Ben Loveday (EUMETSAT)
#
#
# ## Summary
#
# In this example we will conduct matchups of in situ data with PACE OCI satellite data using the ThoMaS (Tool to generate Matchups for OC products with Sentinel-3/OLCI) package. This package provides a comprehensive set of tools to help with the validation of satellite products, supporting many common workflows including:
#
# * satellite data acquisition
# * mini file extraction
# * in situ data management
# * bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction
#
# ThoMaS is written in Python and is made available through a [EUMETSAT Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eumetlab/oceans/ocean-science-studies/ThoMaS). The package can be used from the command line, or imported as a Python library, as done here. This notebook contains an example of how to use ThoMaS, but the capability shown is not exhaustive. Many more command-line examples are included in the repository, and we encourage users to familiarise themselves with both the [project README](https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eumetlab/oceans/ocean-science-studies/ThoMaS/-/blob/main/README.md) and  [example README](https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eumetlab/oceans/ocean-science-studies/ThoMaS/-/blob/main/README_examples.md) for more information.
#
# ## Learning Objectives
#
# At the end of this notebook you will know:
#
# * How to create a configuration file for the ThoMaS matchup toolkit
# * How to run ThoMaS for a full matchup exercise: satellite extractions + minifiles + extraction statistics + matchup statistics
# * Use standard matchup protocols to apply statistics and plot matchup data

# 3. [Run ThoMaS])(#3.-Run ThoMaS)

# ## 1. Setup
#
# Begin by importing all of the packages used in this notebook.

import os
import sys

# We also need to retrieve the toolkit itself. For the hackweek, we have already saved the ThoMaS toolkit under `shared/pace-hackweek-2024/lib/ThoMaS`.
#
# ThoMaS can be used from the [command line](https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eumetlab/oceans/ocean-science-studies/ThoMaS/-/blob/main/README_examples.md), but here we will use it as a Python library. Lets import ThoMaS into our notebook.

sys.path.insert(1, "shared/pace-hackweek-2024/lib/ThoMaS")
from main import ThoMaS_main as ThoMaS

# We also need to save our Earthdata login credentials in our home directory.
#
# Copy your username and password and store them in a JSON file under
# `~/.obpg_credentials.json` (~ stands for your home directory)" <br>

# ## 2. Create configuration file for ThoMaS
#
# In this example we will conduct matchups of in situ AERONET-OC Rrs data with PACE OCI Rrs data. The Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) was developed to sustain atmospheric studies at various scales with measurements from worldwide distributed autonomous sun-photometers. This has been extended to support marine applications, called AERONET â€“ Ocean Color [(AERONET-OC)](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/ocean_levels_versions.html), and provides the additional capability of measuring the radiance emerging from the sea (i.e., water-leaving radiance) with modified sun-photometers installed on offshore platforms like lighthouses, oceanographic and oil towers. AERONET-OC is instrumental in satellite ocean color validation activities.
#
# In this tutorial, we will be collecting Rrs data from the Chesapeake Bay AERONET-OC site located at 39.1N, 76.3W in the upper Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA. The instrument is located 30m high on a USCG-controlled navigational range-light tower surrounded by highly turbid, optically deep 6-8 m depth waters.
#
# Below are our requirements for this workflow:
# 1. I want to test the performance of PACE OCI at the AERONET-OC station Chesapeake_Bay during July 2024.
# 2. I wish to get matchups between this Chesapeake_Bay subset and PACE/OCI Rrs using the standard extraction protocol from [Bailey and Werdell, 2006](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/staff/jeremy/bailey_and_werdell_2006_rse.pdf), using an extraction window of 5x5.
# 3. I want to apply the [Lee et al. ??](link) BRDF correction to both satellite and in situ data.
# 4. Store all outputs in the "Chesapeake_Bay" directory.
#

# Let's first define and create the pathto our main output directory

output_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "Chesapeake_Bay")
if not os.path.exists(output_path):
    os.mkdir(output_path)

# Let's now define out configuration file.

# ## 3. Run ThoMaS

# Now, let's run this configuration and check our outputs

ThoMaS(path_to_config_file)

# If all went well, in our Chesapeake_Bay directory you should now have several folders that contain the outputs from the ThoMaS analysis:
# * SatData contains the full downloaded products
# * SatDataLists contains information on the inventory of downloaded data
# * minifiles contains the extracted minifiles
# * minifilesLists contains information on the inventory of downloaded data
# * EDB, the most important folder, contains the results of the extractions we made from the minifiles.
# * Summary plots of matchups
