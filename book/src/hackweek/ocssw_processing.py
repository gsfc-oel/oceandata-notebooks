# # Processing with OCSSW Command Line Interface (CLI)
#
# **Tutorial Lead:** Carina Poulin (NASA, SSAI)
#
# <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
#
# The following notebooks are **prerequisites** for this tutorial:
#
# - [Earthdata Cloud Access](../earthdata_cloud_access)
# - [Satellite Data Visualization](../satdata_vizualization)
#
# </div>
#
# ## Summary
#
# [SeaDAS][seadas] is the official data analysis sofware of NASA's Ocean Biology Distributed Active Archive Center (OB.DAAC); used to process, display and analyse ocean color data. SeaDAS is a dektop application that includes the Ocean Color Science Software (OCSSW) libraries. There is also a command line interface (CLI) for the OCSSW libraries, which we can use to write processing scripts and notebooks.
#
# This tutorial will show you how to process PACE OCI data using the sequence of OCSSW programs `l2gen`, `l2bin`, and `l3mapgen`.
#
# [seadas]: https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/
#
# ## Learning Objectives
#
# At the end of this notebok you will know:
# * How to process Level-1B data to Level-2 with `l2gen` to make different products including surface reflectances and MOANA phytoplankton products
# * How to merge two images with `l2bin`
# * How to create a map with `l3mapgen`

# ## 1. Setup
#
# Begin by importing all of the packages used in this notebook. If your kernel uses an environment defined following the guidance on the [tutorials] page, then the imports will be successful.
#

# We are also going to define a function to help write OCSSW parameter files, which
# is needed several times in this tutorial. To write the results in the format understood
# by OCSSW, this function uses the `csv.writer` from the Python Standard Library. Instead of
# writing comma-separated values, however, we specify a non-default delimiter to get
# equals-separated values. Not something you usually see in a data file, but it's better than
# writing our own utility from scratch!

def write_par(path, par):
    """Prepare a "par file" to be read by one of the OCSSW tools.

    Using a parameter file is equivalent to specifying parameters

# ## 2. Get L1B Data
#
#
# Set (and persist to your user profile on the host, if needed) your Earthdata Login credentials.

auth = earthaccess.login(persist=True)

# We will use the `earthaccess` search method used in the OCI Data Access notebook. Note that Level-1B (L1B) files
# do not include cloud coverage metadata, so we cannot use that filter. In this search, the spatial filter is
# performed on a location given as a point represented by a tuple of latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.

# +
tspan = ("2024-06-05", "2024-06-05")
location = (40, 45)

results = earthaccess.search_data(
    short_name="PACE_OCI_L1B_SCI",
    temporal=tspan,
    point=location,
)
results[0]
# -

# Download the granules found in the search.

paths = earthaccess.download(results, local_path="data")

# While we have the downloaded location stored in the list `paths`, store one in a variable we won't overwrite for future use.

l2gen_ifile = paths[0]

# The Level-1B files contain top-of-atmosphere reflectances, typically denoted as $\rho_t$.
# On OCI, the reflectances are grouped into blue, red, and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths. Open
# the dataset's "observation_data" group in the netCDF file using `xarray` to plot a "rhot_red"
# wavelength.

dataset = xr.open_dataset(l2gen_ifile, group="observation_data")
artist = dataset["rhot_red"].sel({"red_bands": 100}).plot()

# ## 3. Process L1B Data with `l2gen`
#
# At Level-1, we neither have geophysical variables nor are the data projected for easy map making. We will need to process the L1B file to Level-2 and then to Level-3 to get both of those. Note that Level-2 data for many geophysical variables are available for download from the OB.DAAC, so you often don't need the first step. However, the Level-3 data distributed by the OB.DAAC are global composites, which may cover more Level-2 scenes than you want. You'll learn more about compositing below. `l2gen` also allows you to customize products in a way that allows you to get products you cannot directly download from earthdata, like you will see from the following two examples. The first shows how to produce surface reflectances to make true-color images. The second covers the upcoming MOANA phytoplankton community composition products.
#
# This section shows how to use `l2gen` for processing the L1B data to L2 using customizable parameters.

# OCSSW programs are run from the command line in Bash, but we can have a Bash terminal-in-a-cell using the [IPython magic][magic] command `%%bash`. In the specific case of OCSSW programs, the Bash environment created for that cell must be set up by loading `$OCSSWROOT/OCSSW_bash.env`.
#
# </div>
#
# Every `%%bash` cell that calls an OCSSW program needs to `source` the environment
# definition file shipped with OCSSW, because its effects are not retained from one cell to the next.
# We can, however, define the `OCSSWROOT` environment variable in a way that effects every `%%bash` cell.
#
# [magic]: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#built-in-magic-commands

os.environ.setdefault("OCSSWROOT", "/opt/ocssw")

# Then we need a couple lines, which will appear in multiple cells below, to begin a Bash cell initiated with the `OCSSW_bash.env` file.

# Using this pattern, run the `l2gen` command with the single argument `help` to view the extensive list of options available. You can find more information about `l2gen` and other OCSSW functions on the [seadas website](https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/help-8.3.0/processors/ProcessL2gen.html)

# To process a L1B file using `l2gen`, at a minimum, you need to set an infile name (`ifile`) and an outfile name (`ofile`). You can also indicate a data suite; in this example, we will proceed with the biogeochemical (BGC) suite that includes chlorophyll *a* estimates.
#
# Parameters can be passed to OCSSW programs through a text file. They can also be passed as arguments, but writing to a text file leaves a clear processing record. Define the parameters in a dictionary, then send it to the `write_par` function
# defined in the [Setup](#1.-Setup) section.

# Feel free to explore `l2gen` options to produce the Level-2 dataset you need! The documentation
# for `l2gen` is kind of interactive, because so much depends on the data product being processed.
# For example, try `l2gen ifile=data/PACE_OCI.20240605T092137.L1B.V2.nc dump_options=true` to get
# a lot of information about the specifics of what the `l2gen` program generates.

# ## 4. Make MOANA Phytoplankton Community Products with `l2gen`

# It can be useful to merge adjacent scenes to create a single, larger image. Let's do it with a chlorophyll product.
